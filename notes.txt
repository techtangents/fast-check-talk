/*
sort
- idempotent
- every input appears in the output
- every output appears in the input
- length remains the same
- every element is less than or equal to the next
- sort(x) === sort(x)
- sorting a single-element array is identity

startswith
- a start with a
- a + b starts with a
- everything starts with ""
- "" does not start with anything non-empty
- a does not start with b if b is longer than a
- a does not start with b if a and b are non-empty and constructed from different character classes

array contains
- [x] contains x
- a ++ [x] ++ b contains x
- (remove x from a) does not contain x
- compare two algorithms - array.some vs Set.contains

RBAC
- user has role, role has permission
- does user have permission?
- generating data in a domain
- generating deliberately matching and non-matching data

tests
- user has permission if in role with permission
- user has no permission if only in roles without permission
